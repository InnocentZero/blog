Hi everyone, this is my blog! If you happened to stumble upon over here, let me introduce myself. I am often affectionately called InnocentZero, and as much as it would surprise you, I'm not the [villain](https://mashle.fandom.com/wiki/Innocent_Zero) in most cases. I write code by the day and literature by the night. If you feel confused by all my writings, I'm sorry. These are just the musings of a 14 year old after all.

This is my attempt at having a blog that folows the principle of [working with the garage door up](@/about/philosophy.md). If you are curious about my working philosophies, check [this](./philosophy.md) out.

If you are curious about the blog and how it is structured, read [here](@/about/site_struct.md).

I also host my C++ notes [here](https://innocentzero.github.io/C_CPP_Notes/). If you need my dotfiles, [here they are](https://gitlab.com/InnocentZero/swaydark). WARNING: there is a high likelihood that the dots are out of date.

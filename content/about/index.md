Hi everyone, this is my blog! If you happened to stumble upon over here, let me introduce myself. I am often affectionately called InnocentZero, and as much as it would surprise you, I'm not the [villain](https://mashle.fandom.com/wiki/Innocent_Zero) in most cases. I write code by the day and literature by the night.

This is my attempt at having a blog that folows the principle of [working with the garage door up](@/about/philosophy.md).

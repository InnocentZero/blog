A broken lover seeks to help others and finds a mysterious order with divine knowledge and just one rule, **"Don't break the dogma"**. But when he realises he can use it to bring her back, his will is tested.

<br>When you read the forever corpus
<br>You were ready to take the shrine
<br>Willing to serve a new purpose
<br>Having lost a lover to time
<br>
<br>You wanted in life the greater good
<br>So others could have what you did not
<br>But then nothing really ever stood
<br>To stop you from the fires you wrought
<br>
<br>I had never doubted your intentions
<br>Always seeing the kind in you
<br>I now wish you followed abstention
<br>Being one of the chosen few
<br>
<br>You wished to seek greater knowledge
<br>Hoping it would serve you well
<br>But never once did you ever acknowledge
<br>That you had your purpose defined in hell
<br>
<br>You failed the dogma in countless ways
<br>Having given your will to pain
<br>Never was hell's fire so ablaze
<br>When your lover reached mortal domain
<br>
<br>It was a fatal mistake
<br>And you too, had soon realised
<br>What you did opened the gates
<br>And why the dogma was forever advised
<br>
<br>You managed to undo the agony you brought
<br>Decimating the entire order thereby
<br>Peace shattered and the elders fraught
<br>Only if you had once complied!
<br>
<br>The world was turned to stage of her circus
<br>The order's gone, but the clock still chimes
<br>For you now yearn for a new purpose
<br>Long lost to the trials of time

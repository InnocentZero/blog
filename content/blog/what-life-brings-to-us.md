A heartfelt message written by one lover to another.

When I wonder what brought us together

When I wonder if weâ€™ll last forever

I feel luck to stand by me

Just as close as are we

<br>
When I feel your love to pull on me

When this bond sets my soul free

I wish this moment for all time there is

For this is what my eternal prayer is

<br>
When I think of you, it dispels my fear

When losing you feels a nightmare

I just sit there; I just sob and pray

There be no harm that ever comes your way

<br>
When I hold you close, it shakes my core

When your smile makes me crave for more

Your beauty moves me to great lengths

It is in you that I find my greatest strength

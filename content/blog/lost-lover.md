A lover left stranded decides to tell his tale to the rest of the world.

Happiness lost long ago

I became a sorrow soul

Still believing I’ve let go

The only reason my heart swole

<br>
You parted ways in fame’s pursuit

Leaving me in bitter cold

But justice always follows suit

That’s a truth you were untold

<br>
Insanity begs to jumps down

While sanity feels a nightmare

All I have is a frown

When none of you comes to care

<br>
With each breath that passes by

Time is lost out of hand

It is time I say goodbye

To a world blown like sand

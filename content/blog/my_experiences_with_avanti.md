How I joined one of the best teams ever!

<!-- more -->

I still remember the time I joined Avanti and gave the interview for it. Well, as it turns out the interviewer was pretty impressed! The academic questions they asked me easy enough, but that was because that was not the point of the interview. It was to check whether you would be mentally prepared what what was going to come ahead, should you get selected.

I must introduce Avanti to y'all first. It is an NGO that operates across universities and takes up mentors to teach underprivileged children and prepares them for one of the, if not the toughest college entrance exam in the world. 

It was a privilege and a dream for me, teaching being my passion. My mentee showed great enthusiasm throughout the process, and was very receptive. Sure there were highs and lows, ups and downs, fights and arguments with my teammates as well. But in the end, it gave me the best group of friends I could have asked for. And along with that a lot of memories. All those hours of having fun after meetings, the trips, the lunches, the games, and the satisfaction of seeing my mentee succeed in life. It will always remain unmatched.

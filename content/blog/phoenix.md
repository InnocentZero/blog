What happens when a godlike creature decides to live amongst us?

<!-- more -->

The shadows of night

Under moonlight

Will vanish from sight

When the phoenix burns bright.

<br>
The phoenix burns in a huge fire

Much like an intense desire

Having found something to Admire

In this world of fleeting memoirs.

<br>
It flies fast, leaving a streak.

Things are greater that it seeks.

To it our future looks bleak;

To it we look too meek.

Apologise the right way!

<!-- more -->

I know I have to fight,

I have to reach to a greater height,

I have to spread wisdom and light,

And make this world a little warm and bright.

<br>
My demons haunted me throughout my life,

I know I have to live up the hype,

I tried a lot, yet I can’t stand,

On the top spot, I still can’t land.

<br>
I know I owe you a lot,

For long there were demons I fought,

Within me, for long I sought,

Peace tranquility and a cleaner thought.

<br>
I will have to do what I must,

I’m not just a breeze, I’m a gust.

So please don’t throw me under a bus or a lorry,

For god’s sake, please forgive me, I’m sorry.

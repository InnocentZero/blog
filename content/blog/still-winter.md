A sorrow tale of losing hope in the bureaucracy that drives this world to war.

<!-- more -->


I tell the tale with blood smeared;

Twice as bless’ d yet half afeared.

I stand among the slain remains

When I wish for the street lanes.

---

The masses take the martyrs inked

Yet never once do they even blink

They will not see the toll it takes

For they can’t feel what a war makes

---

I covet being in my home’s ingle

And leaning beside my office shingle

Away from the vacuous carnage

Away from the ministerial garbage

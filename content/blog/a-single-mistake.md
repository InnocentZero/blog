A single mistake can often take away a lt of things in our life, but it's never enough to shatter us completely!

<!-- more -->

That day I made a single mistake

And that is all that it takes

To make me relinquish the joy I found

To leave me littered on the ground

<br>
I always wished for heavenly stars

But all I got were hideous scars

This cruel fate marred my soul

And left me harrowed than a whole

<br>
I never willed a life this torn

Leaving me ravaged and forlorn

My wish for end won’t come near

And I still feel the fear

<br>
All this ends when I say goodbye

But in the end, I seek a reply

“Do I create my own destiny,

Or will I be put out of misery?”

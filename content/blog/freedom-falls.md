A desire to break free from the bounds of society as we know it, a society that perhaps kills our dreams.

In this world where everyone shall start afresh;

In this world where there is no distress;

That time you shall say with astounding glee,

That’s the place where freedom falls,

That’s the place that calls for me.

<br>
In this world where all are one;

In this world where hated are none;

Living under the banner of Almighty thee.

That’s the place where freedom falls,

That’s the place that calls for me.

<br>
Over here no one shall ever resent,

Over here shall never be any dissent.

But for most it’s still a fantasy.

That’s the place where freedom falls,

That’s the place that calls for me.

<br>
Free to have what you can attain,

Free to keep what you can sustain,

That’s the place that sets you free.

That’s the place where freedom falls,

That’s the place that calls for me.

<br>
Over here there is no bound.

I relish the tranquillity I just found.

No one can stop me, neither you nor he.

That’s the place where freedom falls,

That’s the place that calls for me.

<br>
Able to be what you dream,

A paradise is what it seems.

Filling your life with ecstasy,

That’s the place where freedom falls,

That’s the place that calls for me.

<br>
Over here you shall touch the sky.

Shall you bereave your griefs with a sigh,

Go forge your destiny.

That’s the place where freedom falls,

That’s the place that calls for me.

<br>
For its beauty, now behold.

That’s a fantasy still untold.

The moon shines like ivory,

That’s the place where freedom falls,

That’s the place that calls for me.

<br>
I know I have to reach that far;

I know I have to touch the stars.

I’m no more stuck in irony.

That’s the place where freedom falls,

That’s the place that calls for me.

<br>
Now ages and ages hence,

Seeing your past through a blurry lens,

You had a life too lively.

That’s the place where freedom falls,

That’s the place that calls for me.

<br>
You think you know society;

You think we feel satiety.

But that’s not how it’s supposed to be,

For there’s a place where freedom falls,

There’s a place that calls for me.

<br>
For now, that world you are to refute.

There are ancient systems to which you pay tribute.

Till now you are yet to see,

There’s a place where freedom falls,

There’s a place that calls for me.

Let me tell you a story. A story written solely for a single reader. The lone reader who can appreciate this story despite all the shortcomings. A story that became the pillar that supported the existence of that single reader. The single reader that became a pillar that supported my stories.

In the drapes of tales, where readers dwell

A protagonist's journey, they watch and tell

From trials dire to victories won,

The end marks a tale begun.

<br>
In the shadows of the Tower's might,

The reader braves the endless night.

With comrades forged in trials tough,

He charts his path, through times rough.

<br>
Through the realms of chaos and despair,

He finds his way with steadfast care.

And in the whispers of the lore's design,

Endings bloom as beginnings shine.

<br>
Across the pages, the story weaves,

Of hope and loss, of dreams and beliefs.

Each chapter closed, a door unbarred,

To realms unknown, where fate regards.

<br>
Through realms of strife and sacrifice,

The reader stands, his will the dice.

For in the heart of every tale,

Lies the truth, beyond the pale.

<br>
Though shadows linger, and trials ensue,

His journey's end, a dream anew.

For the echo of each goodbye,

Lies the promise of an endless sky.

<br>
Amidst the tapestry, a thread unwinds,

The protagonist lost in time's binds.

Regression echoes, past deeds retold,

As destinies entwine, future foretold.

<br>
With each recurrence, memories flicker,

Of battles fought, bonds being thicker.

In the dance of fate, he finds a role,

A beacon bright in the darkest shoal.

<br>
In the aftermath of the battles fought,

And victories won, though dearly brought,

The reader finds his purpose clear,

As endings fade and futures near.

<br>
With friends and foes, he stands alone,

His story etched in every stone.

Through the realms of chaos and despair,

His legacy being a beacon fair.

<br>
The is end is but a threshold to begin,

A chance for hope, for dreams to spin.

In the vast expanse of worlds untold,

The reader's tale is forever bold.

<br>
So let the echoes of the lore resound,

As adventures await, yet unbound.

For in the cycle of rise and fall,

The end is just the beginning's call.

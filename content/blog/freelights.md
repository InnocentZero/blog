A sole traveller on the path of seeking "the true light" recounts his adventures.

<!-- more -->

Long ago I saw those lights

Shimmering stars that had a beckoning

Perched upon those towering heights

I was drawn without a reckoning


<br>
The lights had called many before

Fireflies that were gleaming bright

They all desired to see it more

And didn't feel an ounce of fright

<br>
In the still midnight air

The light beaconed to nomadic folks

Guiding souls with dreams to spare

To lead astray the beacon coaxed

<br>
I walked the way for countless nights

Defeated bodies adorned the way

I had to see countless fights 

And numerous being led astray

<br>
The path had raised a lot of doubts 

If what I did was even right

What this all was even about

If it was all worth a fight

<br>
But in the end, I found peace

Knowledge abound, my soul released

For those shimmering stars were not just lights

They were the beacons of wisdom, infinite sights

<br>
Perched upon those towering heights so grand

They held the keys to understanding, hand in hand

I realized that the journey was the prize

A quest for truth, where the soul truly flies

<br>
The doubts and fears, they all did fade

As I delved into the secrets they displayed

Each star a lesson, each night a chance

To grow, to learn, to truly advance

<br>
So I continued on that winding trail

Through hardship, through joy, through every travail

For in the end, I found my way

To the wisdom of the stars, where I'll forever stay
